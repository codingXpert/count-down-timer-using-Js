## Why?

Helping people learn how to code requires a *simple* but *functional* example.


**_Everyone_** has experience using a countdown timer.
Whether at the time of any upcomming event,
we can also used it as a reminder,
we can all *immediately* see the *use* of a stopwatch.

## How?
Open the **index.html** in your web browser and try the **_countdown_ timer**.
Then read the code in the files to understand how it all works!


### Interface
I tried to simplify the UI as much as possible.
